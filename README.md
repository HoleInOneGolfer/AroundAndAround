# Around and Around v2

## How to Play

Press **[SPACE]** to **change which direction** the orb is rotating so you can **collect dots**. The **different color dots do different things** from **points**, **reversing direction**, **speeding up**, and **slowing down**.

## About the Project

I have been learning C as part of a college course, so I wanted to give raylib a try and this is my first game written with it.
